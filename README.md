# hello-world
I'm a beginner programmer learning how to use GitHub. Trying to keep up the atomic habit of making 1 commit per day no matter how tiny or useless it is. I'm starting by attempting the easiest project euler problems and uploading the solutions. For the ones I've already solved in the past but have lost the solutions to, I am using ChatGPT to help me get the solution.
